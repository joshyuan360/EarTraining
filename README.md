Ideal for music students preparing for conservatory exams.  

Ear Training is designed to help music students prepare for conservatory exams. The app will never repeat the same sequence of intervals, chords, or cadences. This avoids the repetition that often results from using standard ear training books. The same interval/chord/cadence is repeated when an incorrect answer is selected.  

Both increasing and decreasing intervals may be tested. Chord inversions are included. The app is able to generate hundreds of unique cadences by considering a variety of different chord progressions, SATB arrangements, and keys.
